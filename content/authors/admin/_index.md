Currently, I am working as a postdoc in the Intelligent Control lab under the supervision of Prof. Leehter Yao at Taipei Tech, Taiwan. My research interest broadly includes Computer Vision, Biometrics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I received my Ph.D. in computer science & engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Indore, India in March 2023. During my PhD, I worked in the Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence lab under the supervision of Dr. Surya Prakash. In my PhD thesis work, I worked in the area of biometric template protection that includes the development of secure and efficient techniques to protect the fingerprint user template stored in the database as the databases are vulnerable to attack which can cause an identity theft of a user.
